# Changes for Join/Leave Channel Feature & ChannelView UI Improvements May 26

## Backend (FastAPI)

- **Added join channel logic:**
  - Updated `/channels/{channel_id}/join` endpoint to insert directly into the `channel_user_link` association table.
  - Fixed import and usage of the association table (`channel_user_link`) from `app.models.association_tables`.
- **Fixed joined status in channel list:**
  - Updated `/channels/` endpoint to check the association table directly for whether the current user has joined each channel.
- **Added leave channel endpoint:**
  - New endpoint: `POST /channels/{channel_id}/leave` removes the user from the `channel_user_link` table.

## Frontend (React)

- **Channels list:**
  - Made all channel cards clickable, not just joined ones.
  - Clicking a channel card calls `onChannelClick(ch.id)`.
- **Join channel:**
  - Clicking the "Join" button on a channel card calls the backend to join the channel and updates the UI.
- **ChannelView UI/UX:**
  - Added a "Leave Channel" button, now positioned at the top right of the channel header.
  - "Back to Channels" button is at the top left of the header.
  - Channel info (title, description, meta) is centered in the header.
  - ChannelView header/banner now uses the same gradient as the Edora dashboard header for visual consistency.
  - Header height and padding have been adjusted for a thinner, more modern look.
  - Posts inside the channel now stack vertically (one per row) instead of in a grid.
  - Post cards have been made smaller, thinner, and more compact for a denser feed appearance.

These changes enable users to join and leave channels, and provide a modern, visually consistent, and user-friendly ChannelView experience.
