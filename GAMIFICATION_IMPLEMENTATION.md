# Gamification System Implementation

## Overview

The gamification system has been successfully implemented in the Edora application. It awards points to users for various activities to encourage engagement and participation.

## Point System

### Point Awards
- **10 points** for uploading/creating a post
- **5 points** for writing a comment
- **1 point** for receiving a like on your post

### Point Deductions
- **1 point** is removed when a like is removed from your post

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

1. **User Model** (`app/models/user.py`)
   - Added `points` field to track user gamification points
   - Default value: 0

2. **New Gamification Models** (`app/gamification/models.py`)
   - `PointTransaction`: Tracks all point transactions with details
   - `ActionType`: Enum for different types of actions
   - `UserPointsRead`: Model for leaderboard display

### Services

**GamificationService** (`app/gamification/service.py`)
- `award_points()`: Awards points to users and creates transaction records
- `remove_points()`: Removes points from users
- `get_user_points()`: Gets current points for a user
- `get_user_transactions()`: Gets transaction history
- `get_leaderboard()`: Gets top users by points

### API Endpoints

**Gamification API** (`/api/gamification/`)
- `GET /my-points`: Get current user's points
- `GET /my-transactions`: Get user's point transaction history
- `GET /leaderboard`: Get points leaderboard
- `GET /user/{user_id}/points`: Get points for a specific user

### Integration Points

1. **Posts API** (`app/api/posts.py`)
   - Awards 10 points when a post is created
   - Creates transaction record with post details

2. **Comments API** (`app/api/comments.py`)
   - Awards 5 points when a comment is created
   - Creates transaction record with comment details

3. **Reactions API** (`app/api/reactions.py`)
   - Awards 1 point to post author when receiving a like
   - Removes 1 point when a like is removed
   - Handles like/dislike changes appropriately

## Database Migration

A migration was created and applied to:
- Add `points` field to the User table
- Create the `PointTransaction` table
- Set up proper foreign key relationships

## Features

### Transaction Tracking
- Every point award/deduction is logged with:
  - User ID
  - Points changed (positive or negative)
  - Action type (POST_UPLOAD, COMMENT, LIKE_RECEIVED, LIKE_REMOVED)
  - Description of the action
  - Related entity ID and type
  - Timestamp

### Leaderboard
- Shows top users by points
- Includes rank calculation
- Publicly accessible

### User Points
- Users can view their current points
- Users can view their transaction history
- Public endpoints for viewing other users' points

## Usage Examples

### Check Your Points
```bash
GET /api/gamification/my-points
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### View Leaderboard
```bash
GET /api/gamification/leaderboard?limit=10
```

### View Transaction History
```bash
GET /api/gamification/my-transactions?limit=50
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_gamification.py`) has been created to verify:
- User registration/login
- Point awarding for posts (10 points)
- Point awarding for comments (5 points)
- Transaction history tracking
- Leaderboard functionality

## Benefits

1. **User Engagement**: Encourages users to contribute content
2. **Quality Content**: Rewards valuable contributions with likes
3. **Transparency**: Full transaction history for accountability
4. **Competition**: Leaderboard creates friendly competition
5. **Scalability**: System can easily be extended with new point types

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Additional point types (first post of the day, streak bonuses, etc.)
- Point multipliers for special events
- Badges and achievements
- Point redemption system
- Daily/weekly/monthly leaderboards
- Point decay over time for inactive users
